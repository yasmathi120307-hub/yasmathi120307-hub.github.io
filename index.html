    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            I am a B.Com (Information Technology) undergraduate with a strong inclination towards
            technology, finance, and business intelligence. A quick learner with the ability to
            grasp concepts efficiently, I actively explore programming, analytical thinking, and
            real-world problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I take pride in leadership and communication, having served as the
            Vice President of my department, an active Synergy Council member, and a confident
            public speaker and Master of Ceremonies.
